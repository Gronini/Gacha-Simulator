<h1>Gacha Simulator Terms of Service</h1>
<h2>Do not use our services in any way that violates Canadian law:</h2>
<p>This term specifies that using Gacha Simulator in any way that goes against the law of Canada is not allowed. Since our service is based in Canada, it is subject to the country's laws.</p>
<h2>Do not use our services in any way that violates Discord's Terms of Service:</h2>
<p>As Gacha Simulator is hosted on Discord, users must comply with their rules and regulations as well. Any violation of their terms of service can result in suspension or termination of the account.</p>
<h2>Don't use our services to incite harassment:</h2>
<p>Gacha Simulator is meant to be a fun simulation game, and any attempts to use the service to incite hatred, bullying, or harassment is not allowed. Any such behavior can result in suspension or termination of the account.</p>
<h2>Do not try to exploit bugs in the bot for your own gain:</h2>
<p>Our service provides a simulation of Cookie Run gacha mechanics, and users must not attempt to exploit any bugs or glitches in the bot to gain an unfair advantage. Such actions can result in account clearance or suspension.</p>
<h2>Do not make any attempts to bypass any restrictions made on you:</h2>
<p>If a user's access to the bot has been revoked, they should not try to bypass any restrictions imposed on them. If a user feels that their access has been mistakenly revoked, they can contact us to rectify the issue.</p>
